  title: Lifecycle Visualization
  description: 
    body: This is an opinionated visual and accompanying outline to help demonstrate what a complete digital product can be when you adopt an API-first strategy, providing a common approach to defining the API lifecycle, governance, tooling, and which roles are needed to move APIs forward.
    tip: This is one approach to delivering a consistent API across a common lifecycle while considering governance, and the roles in place. This blueprint will not reflect the needs of every organization, but provides a nice template to consider as you are building your own strategy.
  type: 
    body: HTTP / Web / REST API
    tip: This lifecycle has been validated against existing web APIs, providing your most simplest, but also most broad approach to how you can do APIs.
  approach: 
    body: Design-Led
    tip: This blueprint is opinionated about following a design-led approach to delivering an API, iterating on the contract amongst stakeholders before any code gets written.
  visibility:
    body: Public
    tip: This is a blueprint for a publicly available API, and we should take into consideration what happens when anyone around the world can access it.
  maturity:
    body: Production
    tip: This blueprint is meant to cover the needs of an API in production, requiring the most comprehensive quality, security, and governance.
  lifecycle:
