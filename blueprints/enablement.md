## Enablement 
An API-first enterprise understands that operations is defined by the enablement that exists for teams to do the right thing on the ground floor. Establishing a clear list of what tools are needed by developers when it comes to producing and consuming APIs, then making sure they have access to them as part of their regular work. Helping augment the variety of roles involved in bringing APIs to life, and then also putting them to work in applications and integrations that are powering business today. 

### Elements 
 

- **Platform** - Setup your API platform, beginning with your source control, CI/CD, gateways, and APM, but then evolving towards other stops along the API lifecycle, taking full advantage of the APIs behind your infrastructure to stabilize your developers.  
- **Integrations** - Lean on industrial-grade integrations to bring together the services needed to make producing and consuming APIs as seamless and native as possible for all stakeholders, realizing that APIs aren’t just for applications, but needed behind APIs. 
- **Tooling** - Empower developers with the tools they need, providing bedrock tooling like source control, CI/CD, and IDE, but then encourage and foster exploration of new commercial and open-source tooling, providing tracks to formalize team adoption. 
- **Collaboration** - Modern API development teams aren’t locked away anymore, and producing and consuming APIs is a team effort across business and technical groups, providing a huge opportunity to enable teams productivity through more collaboration. 
- **Automation** - Help teams automate at every turn, documenting and then automating common processes that do not need human execution and intervention, equipping teams to schedule and bake workflows into the CI/CD pipeline as part of their work. 
- **Observability** - Make observability available to teams, allowing them to understand the health of their APIs, and how their APIs compare to what other teams are building, helping encourage teamslearn from other teams and allow them to pick up new skills. 
 
Remember, the success of your governance effort will be the direct reflection of the enablement provided to teams. Nobody cares about governance on the ground floor, and just news to be supported in doing the right thing, which is much easier to provide with an API-first platform approach. When teams are fully equipped to do the right thing in the moment, with the right training and tools, this is where you begin to see productivity, quality, and governance shift into a higher gear.
