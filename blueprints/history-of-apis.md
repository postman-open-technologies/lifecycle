# History of APIs
APIs are not new, and are something that emerged in the earliest days of digital computing back in the 1950s, but are something that has evolved to meet the needs of a variety of business sectors, and have seen a massive standardization and growth as a result of the web and emergence of mobile networks.

## Planting Early Seeds
​​The compute and network origins of APIs begins in the early days of computer technology, realizing that this new technology realizes the greatest impact when used in a collaborative way.

- SAGE
- Sabre
- Arpanet

## Laying the Foundation
By the 1970s the earliest networks were being established, resulting in the need to share files, communicate via messages, and better explore how early APIs can be used for business. 

- FTP
- EDI
- Email

## Conducting Business
The business value of early APIs were clear, there was just much more work to be done when it comes to standardizing how we would be able to communicate via the new networks we had developed.

- Corba
- XML
- SOA

As the web emerged, many industry forces came together to formalize XML specifications in service of a SOA vision for industry, but the simpler, more low-cost, and increasingly ubiquitous web would provide a much more powerful approach to delivering the digital resources and capabilities we would need.
