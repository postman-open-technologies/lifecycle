## Open Technologies Standard Support 
Postman Open Technologies works with standards bodies to help move their specifications forward using open source specifications like OpenAPI and AsyncAPI, helping define common objects across those contracts using JSON Schema, and document and certify them via a publicly available workspace that the community can engage and work with. 

### Deliverables 
We help our open standards and specification partners with the following: 

- **Team Profile** - We want your organization to have a robust team profile in our network of 20M API producers and consumers.. 
- **Public Workspace** - We can help you setup, configure, and drive attention to your public API standards workspace, and make it available via your public team profile, and embedded in your existing documentation and portal. 
- **OpenAPI Source of Truth** - We can provide feedback and guidance on managing OpenAPI for your standards. 
- **OpenAPI Versioning** - We want to help offer guidance when it comes to versioning your API standards over time. 
- **Reference Documentation** - We can help you automatically generate reference documentation for your standards. 
- **Use Case Documentation** - We can help you develop specific business use case documentation for your standards. 
- **Github Syncing** - We can help you sync your source of truth OpenAPI, and documentation to a public Github repository. 
- **Mock Servers** - We can help you develop mock servers for entire standard or for specific business use cases. 
- **Certification** - We can help you develop modular, sharable, executable tests to certify implementations of your standard.

### Channels
