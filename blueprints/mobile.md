# Our Lives Going Mobile
Mobile phones have been around since the 20th century, but in 2007 everything would change with the introduction of the iPhone from Apple. These new mobile devices would popularize a new category of Internet connection applications that we’d carry around with us in our pockets, requiring an entirely new set of digital resources, and unlocking an unlimited realm of possibilities when it came to new types of Internet-enabled digital capabilities.

## Devices
There have been many different mobile devices and operating systems to emerge in the last couple of decades, but the iPhone from Apple and Android OS backed by a variety of mobile devices continue to dominate the mobile landscape.

- **iPhone** - In 2004, a team of a thousand Apple employees began work on a secret project. Steve Jobs had noted that with the rising popularity of personal digital assistants (PDAs), many people were carrying around multiple devices: a mobile phone, an iPod, and a PDA. Apple collaborated with wireless carrier Cingular (now AT&T) for 30 months to develop the first iPhone, which aimed to combine these three devices into one. In January 2007, Apple first announced the iPhone, and it was released the following June. Unlike other mobile phones at the time, the iPhone's interface was designed around its touch screen and singular button, and its music player resembled the iPod that was already familiar to many people. The iPhone provided screen space that made web browsing, sending and reading emails, and viewing maps easier than they had ever been on a mobile phone. A year after the first iPhone launch, the App Store opened, allowing third party developers to make their applications available to any iPhone user.
- **Android** - In 2003, a small startup called Android Inc was formed in Palo Alto, California. Android Inc began working on a Linux-based operating system that would connect digital cameras to the cloud, but they soon found that the market was too small and shifted their focus to mobile phones. Google purchased Android Inc in 2005 and continued development, marketing the open source operating system to handset makers and wireless carriers. In 2006, early Android phone prototypes had full QWERTY keyboards and resembled existing smartphones that ran Windows Mobile or BlackBerry OS. After the iPhone released in 2007, Google began working on support for touchscreen controls in Android. The first Android phone, the HTC Dream (known as T-Mobile G1 in the United States), released in September 2008, a few months after the second version of the iPhone launched. Unlike the iPhone, this Android phone included an app store at launch, which was then called the Android Market.

## Resources
Early mobile application developers realize that they could deliver the digital resources they needed on their mobile applications, and waves of API providers emerged to provide the essential digital resources we would be needing to power the growing spectrum of mobile applications being installed to the desktop of these powerful mobile computing devices.

- **Twilio (SMS)** - Twilio was founded in November 2008 with the goal of integrating phone services into software. When Twilio Voice launched, it included an API that enabled developers to make and receive phone calls that were hosted in the cloud. This API could be used to make phone calls and play recordings, so it made automated phone calls possible. In February 2010, the Twilio text messaging API launched, which allowed customers to send a text query to a business and receive an automatic SMS reply. Developers can use the Twilio Programmable Messaging API to send and receive SMS messages to app users, and they can also track message delivery.
- **SendGrid (Email)** - In the early 2000s, Isaac Saldana began working on a solution to the email deliverability problems that many startups seemed to have in common. For example, email providers often marked legitimate messages from businesses as spam, and it was difficult for a business to gather any analytics about the emails they sent. These types of email included shipping notifications, sign-up confirmations, password reset requests, and other important automated messages. Saldana wanted to make it easier for developers to integrate email into their apps in a way that made sure customers received messages that were important and relevant. He started to develop an email management platform at smtpapi.com, offering it to Internet service providers (ISPs) for free in exchange for the computing resources that were required to keep it running. When it became clear that developers found value in this service, Saldana and recruited two other co-founders to officially launch SendGrid in 2009. The SendGrid platform manages email servers and infrastructure, as well as ISP monitoring, which includes monitoring email sender reputations and managing allowlists. Developers can also use the SendGrid platform to track what happens to emails after they reach a customer, such as unsubscribes, bounces, and spam reports. SendGrid makes APIs available to developers, who can then configure their apps to communicate with SendGrid.
- **Stripe (Payments)** - Brothers Patrick and John Collison launched several apps and startups as teenagers, and they noticed that with each Internet business they started, the most challenging part was setting up a way for customers to pay. At the time, e-commerce companies had to choose between setting up a gateway between their app and a legacy banking system directly, or using PayPal, whose regulations could cause revenue to be held up in reserves for months, in some cases. In 2008, the Collison brothers began to try solving this problem using a simple, consistent API. They wrote seven lines of code that allowed an app to communicate with a payment system. After iterating on this code, they founded Stripe in 2010. While Stripe originally partnered with a company that handled payments, they then chose to move payment processing to their internal servers so that they could control the process from beginning to end. Stripe processes credit card payments, checks for fraudulent transactions, and charges a percentage for each transaction. Developers can integrate the Stripe API into their app, which allows the app to securely accept credit cards from customers.
- **Google Maps (Maps)** - In 2003, an Australian mapping startup named Where 2 Technologies developed a desktop application in C++, which they called Expedition. In 2004, Google acquired Where 2 Technologies and released Expedition as the Google Maps web application. In 2005, Google launched the Google Maps API, which allowed developers to use their maps on their own websites. The Google Maps API made it possible for developers to embed maps into a website and include their own overlay content, retrieve static images of maps, generate navigation instructions, and retrieve other map information such as elevation and landmarks. The Google Maps API is currently the most-used web application API. In 2008, Google launched the Google Maps app for Android, around the same time the HTC Dream was released.
